# Copy this file to a new file named '.env' to automatically load these
# values as environment variables when running the client.
# You will need to fill in the values based on which scenario you are
# running against:
# 1. A client testing against a Structure registered locally in the 
#    Skatepark emulator.
# 2. A client running against a Structure hosted in Griptape Cloud.

# If the Structure is running in the Skatepark emulator, this value
# will be the ID returned when building or registering the Structure
# from the CLI.
# In Griptape Cloud, it will be the ID of the structure as found on
# https://cloud.griptape.ai/structures .
GT_STRUCTURE_ID=YOUR_STRUCTURE_ID_HERE

# If running against the Skatepark emulator, you will need to set
# this environment variable (or put it in a .env file) to tell the
# client which URL Skatepark is listening on. The default value is
# http://127.0.0.1:5000 .
# For a Structure in Griptape Cloud, this environment variable 
# should be set to https://cloud.griptape.ai/ .

# The Skatepark emulator does NOT require a Griptape API key.
# However, Griptape Cloud requires a valid API Key in order
# to authorize calling the API. You can generate a key by
# visiting https://cloud.griptape.ai/keys
GT_CLOUD_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

# When running in Griptape Cloud, the Structure first reports
# a status of QUEUED before transitioning to RUNNING. Skatepark
# emulates this behavior by applying a default time to remain 
# in the QUEUED state in order to allow your client to 
# handle this state appropriately.
# You can override the time that the Structure remains in
# the QUEUED state within Skatepark by setting the environment
# variable GT_SKATEPARK_QUEUE_DELAY to the desired time in seconds.
